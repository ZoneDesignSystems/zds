Zone Design Studio (ZDS)

ZDS is a set of computational applications, which seeks to optimise objective functions 
such as similarity or target population sizes, zone compactness and social homogeneity, 
while grouping a large number of areal units into a smaller number of output areas (zones). 
The ZDS is consisted of the following applications:


1: Contiguity And Data builder (arCADia)
   Main features: On Progress.
2: ZOne DesIgn Algorithm (ZODIAc)
   Main features: On Progress.
3: Aic AggREgation system (AwARE)
   Main features: On Progress.
4: Gpu AggregaTion system (GATe)
   Main features: On Progress.
5: Openshaw's zOne Procedure (lOOP)
   Main features: On Progress.
6: EXhaustive AggregaTion system (EXAcT)
   Main features: On Progress.
